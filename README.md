# Pong-Game
Source code for the 30010 Programming Project at DTU.

General requirements:

• Must be implemented on an ARM Cortex M4 CPU using EmBitz 1.11.

• Clear and logical separation of C code in functional libraries.

• Three layers: Application Layer, API and HAL.

• The program must use GPIOs, Timer, IRQ, PuTTY and on-board LCD.

• Application Layer must be documented using flow charts

• API and HAL are documented by boxes with names, variables and internal functions.

• Global variables may only be used if strictly necessary

• All numbers must be fixed-point.

Added requirements:

• Multiple balls

• Games controlled through PuTTY

• Result / high score

• View info for RBG LED

• Game controlled by joystick

• Sound from buzz


The goal of this programming project is to write a working application, in our case an Arkanoid-type
game, and executed it on a microcontroller system. To do this we need to have the skills to analyze a
medium-size programming problem, to be able to construct and implement the different functione and
monduels we want. 

The project, and especially the
application, is developed with the help of flowcharts and blockdiagrams. With the help of these basic
tools the final application is developed. After this some additional testing and debugging has been
done to vertify the initialization of the program on the microprocessor
